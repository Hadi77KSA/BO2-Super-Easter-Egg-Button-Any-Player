# BO2-Super-Easter-Egg-Button-Any-Player
This script allows for the BO2 Super Easter Egg button to be accessible with any number of players as long as: the players have, collectively, inserted the Navcards on all three Victis maps of TranZit, Die Rise, and Buried; and each player in the lobby has completed the Victis maps' Easter Eggs on the same side across the maps; and the completed side across all players is the same.

If there are more than 4 players in the lobby, the script will only check the progress made by 4 players.

## Installation
1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/Hadi77KSA/BO2-Super-Easter-Egg-Button-Any-Player/releases/latest) page and download the mod's file.
2. Navigate to where the Plutonium T6 scripts folder for Zombies is located, typically: `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm`
3. Place the downloaded script file into a folder named `zm_buried`. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.
